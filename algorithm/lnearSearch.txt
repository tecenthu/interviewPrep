Algorithm for Linear Search Algorithm:
The algorithm for linear search can be broken down into the following steps:

Start: Begin at the first element of the collection of elements.
Compare: Compare the current element with the desired element.
Found: If the current element is equal to the desired element, return true or index to the current element.
Move: Otherwise, move to the next element in the collection.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until we have reached the end of collection.
Not found: If the end of the collection is reached without finding the desired element, return that the desired element is not in the array.
